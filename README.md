# sd2-retranslation

Retranslation of Seiken Densetsu 2 (Secret of Mana)

This repository does NOT provide the original ROM or redistribute the text or
scripts of the original games.
Provide and rename your own unheadered US Secret of Mana ROM to "som.orig.sfc"
before using the included batch files.

Use the extract-som.bat files to extract the scripts.

The same process can be used with an sd2.orig.sfc file for a Japanese
Seiken Densetsu 2 ROM and with a turbo.sfc file for a Secret of Mana, Turbo
ROM with FuSoYa's VWF patch enabled.
